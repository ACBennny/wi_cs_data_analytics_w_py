5zpr-dehc,Traffic Signals Status,"This dataset reports on the operation state of traffic signals in Austin, TX.  Traffic signals enter flash mode when something is preventing the signal from operating normally.  This is typically the result of a power surge, power outage, or damage to signal equipment.  A signal may also be intentionally placed into flash mode for maintenance purposes or be scheduled to flash overnight.  

You can view an interactive map of flashing traffic signals here:

https://data.mobility.austin.gov/signal-monitor

Approximately 90% of the City’s signals communicate with our Advanced Transportation Management System.  When these signals go on flash, they will be reported in this dataset.  Although we are extending communications to all signals, approximately 10% are not currently captured in this dataset.  It also occasionally happens that the event that disables a traffic signal also disables network communication to the signal, in which case the signal outage will not be reported here. 



In this dataset the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled flash is identified by the 'operation state' column.  A signal that is in unscheduled flash mode will have a status of 2 or 7.  A signal that is in in scheduled flash mode will have a status of 1.

Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network


How does the City of Austin use the Bluetooth travel sensor data?
The data enables transportation engineers to better understand short and long-term trends in Austin’s traffic patterns, supporting decisions about systems planning and traffic signal timing.

What information does the data contain?
The sensor data is available in three datasets:

Individual Address Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Addresses/qnpj-zrb9/data )
Each row in this dataset represents a Bluetooth device that was detected by one of our sensors. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network

Individual Traffic Matches ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Traffic-Matche/x44q-icha/data )
Each row in this dataset represents one Bluetooth enabled device that detected at two locations in the roadway network. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with contain information about origin and destination points at which the device was detected, as well the time, date, and distance traveled. 

Traffic Summary Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Match-Summary-Records/v7zg-5jg9 )
The traffic summary records contain aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records. Each row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals. 

Does this data contain personally identifiable information?

Individual Address Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Addresses/qnpj-zrb9/data )
Each row in this dataset represents a Bluetooth device that was detected by one of our sensors. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network

Individual Traffic Matches ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Traffic-Matche/x44q-icha/data )
Each row in this dataset represents one Bluetooth enabled device that detected at two locations in the roadway network. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with contain information about origin and destination points at which the device was detected, as well the time, date, and distance traveled.

Traffic Summary Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Match-Summary-Records/v7zg-5jg9 )
The traffic summary records contain aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records. Each row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals.

Does this data contain personally identifiable information?

8m55-9ai3,Bluetooth Travel Sensors -Traffic Match Summary Records (TMSR) UT-CTR TEST,"View the Complete Dataset documentation on Github:
https://github.com/cityofaustin/hack-the-traffic/tree/master/docs

This dataset contains aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records from the City of Austin's Bluetooth travel sensors.. Each row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals.


How does the City of Austin use the Bluetooth travel sensor data?
The data enables transportation engineers to better understand short and long-term trends in Austin’s traffic patterns, supporting decisions about systems planning and traffic signal timing.

What information does the data contain?
The sensor data is available in three datasets:
    
Individual Address Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Addresses/qnpj-zrb9/data )
Each row in this dataset represents a Bluetooth device that was detected by one of our sensors. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network

Individual Traffic Matches ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Traffic-Matche/x44q-icha/data )
Each row in this dataset represents one Bluetooth enabled device that detected at two locations in the roadway network. Each record contains a detected device’s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with contain information about origin and destination points at which the device was detected, as well the time, date, and distance traveled. 

Traffic Summary Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Match-Summary-Records/v7zg-5jg9 )
The traffic summary records contain aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records. Each  row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals.

Crash data may take several weeks to be submitted, reviewed, and finalized for inclusion in this dataset. 

To provide the most accurate information as possible, we only provide crash data as recent as two weeks old. 

Please also note that some crash records may take even longer to appear in this dataset, depending on the circumstances of the crash and the ensuing law enforcement investigation.

Crash data is obtained from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Crash Record Information System (CRIS) database, which is populated by reports submitted by Texas Peace Officers throughout the state, including Austin Police Department (APD).
